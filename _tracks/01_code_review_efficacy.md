The reviewing track will explore ways to make code reviewing more effective and efficient. A major element is how LLM tools relate to reviewing, either when code is produced by them (in which case a human must review plausible-looking but possibly incorrect code), or when they can assist the reviewing of code created by humans. Other related research involves making tieing reviews more closely with the project's history and the semantics of the reviewed code.
