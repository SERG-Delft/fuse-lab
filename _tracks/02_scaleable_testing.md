Scalable testing (Track 2) focuses on developing intelligent and efficient approaches to testing massive software systems. Traditional testing methods often break down at scale due to long regression cycles, high infrastructure costs, and flaky test suites. Our research explores learning-based and intent-driven techniques that go beyond coverage metrics to emphasize risk-based prioritization, automated smoke test generation, intent mutation testing, and test refactoring. We aim to redefine what "good" coverage means--reducing failures in production, minimizing review overhead, and ensuring testing keeps pace with rapid, large-scale software evolution.
